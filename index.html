                        <h2>How long do balloons last indoors?<br></h2>
                        <p class="lead">Many air filled balloon designs can last weeks indoors! The longevity of the balloons will depend on the environmental conditions of the space.<br></p>
                        <h2>How long will my helium balloons float?<br></h2>
                        <p class="lead">All of our helium balloons will float for at least 3 days if indoors, but typically much longer!<br></p>

                        <h2>How long do balloons last outdoors?<br></h2>
                        <p class="lead">INDOOR - Many air filled balloon designs can last weeks indoors! The longevity of the balloons will depend on the environmental conditions of the space. All of our helium balloons will float for at least 3 days if indoors, but typically much longer!<br></p>
                        <p class="lead">OUTDOOR - We cannot guarantee that balloons will last any specific amount of time when used outdoor. The sun, heat, wind, rain, etc., affects the lifespan of the balloons.<br></p>
                        <h2>How much do balloon decor services cost?<br></h2>
                        <p class="lead">The coast of the balloon decoration can varies depending on the volume and complexity of your request. To give you a better pricing idea for your event a typical kids party ranges from $100 to $600 and a large corporate event can be upwards of $400 - $3000. Check out our Balloon Price Guide for some basic prices including individual items and package deals.<br></p>
                        <h2>Are balloons biodegradable or can they be recycled?<br></h2>
                        <p class="lead">Yes! Our latex balloons are made of natural materials and are 100% biodegradable at the same rate as an oak leaf. Mylar (or foil) balloons are NOT biodegradable but are able to be recycled. BoomBalloon is an active member of PEBA (Pro-Environmental Balloon Alliance )<br></p>
                        <h2>I bought some balloons from somewhere else, can you inflate them for me?<br></h2>
                        <p class="lead">Yes, but we cannot guarantee the quality of balloons not provided by us. If they are defective or burst during or after inflation, you will still be charged the full amount for that balloon. We also can not speculate about the longevity of balloons not provided by us.<br></p>

                <h2> Story of Boomballoon</h2>
                <p>BoomBalloon started as a long-term hobby by decorating families’ and friend’s birthday parties and event with colorful balloons. In May, 2017, BoomBalloon officially opens its doors to the world and becoming a successful balloon decoration business in Charleston area. We offer only the finest quality products made in the USA and we are happy to help you design custom arrangements that will ensure your event is a huge success.</p><br>

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Marina Washington, owner of BoomBalloon in Charleston, SC and I've been in love with balloons since I was a kid in Kazakhstan. After graduating Design University in major Interior design, my passion and dedication to the craft of balloon art has taken me to United States to follow my dream and meet international masters at the Balloon Art Conventions.

                    My passion is to create wonderful memories for my clients as they celebrate the important, joyful moments in their lives. It's incredibly satisfying for me to share my art with so many people, and to have them come back year-after-year inviting me once again to be part of their celebrations.

                    In short - my work, my passion is to provide outstanding service and lasting memories to the individuals and families I'm fortunate enough to meet through BoomBalloon.<br>

                    Cheers!

                            BoomBalloon is fantastic. Marina's creativity, professionalism, service, and pricing are really fabulous. We have used BoomBalloon for multiple corporate events (a company with 1,000+ people) and Marina has knocked it out of the park every time. We couldn't be happier with the service and creations, and will definitely continue to use BoomBalloon in the future!
